# Multi dot sims

This code is for obtaining response of multiple dots to anisotropy

- "macrospin-nanomagnet_nodemag_2topown_0-kprime.mx3" : Series of increasing size arrays. Macrospin dots with no demag. Number of dots along each (x,y) axis scaled by (2^n)/2. Kprime is 0. Very fast!
- "nanomagnet_nodemag_2topow1_1-kprime.mx3" : Large dots with no demag. Number of dots along each (x,y) axis scaled by (2^1)/2. Kprime is 0.
- "nanomagnet_2topow1_0-kprime.mx3" : Large dots with demag on. Number of dots along each (x,y) axis scaled by (2^1)/2. Kprime is 0.
