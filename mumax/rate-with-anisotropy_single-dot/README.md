# Rate with anisotropy (single dot)

This code is for testing how the rate changes when a second anisotropy term is added in

Based on original parameters from "single_nanomagnet_no_input_6.mx3" from Axel-initial-sims.

- "single_nanomagnet_0-kprime.mx3" is the base case. Intrinsic anisotropy defined by a custom field, additional anisotropy defined as 0*Kmain along 45 degrees. Should be effectively the same as Axel's original sim, but defined with custom anisotropy field.
